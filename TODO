idea bucket-------------------------------------
threads are 'maxed' by taking the average activity on a post and divideit by the average activity on all posts on that forum and multiple the denomiter by .05 then the numerator by 2
then add 950(kinda of a loose post limit), for every post subtract one, every image post 1.3.

activity is caculated by, posts(not including op's) divided by time thread is alive in minutes

(((non op posts/time thread is alive)*2)/(acitivity on all posts in forum * .05)) + 950 - 1(# of posts) - 1.3(# of image posts)
once this hits zero the thread is 404ed


when posts are sorted by 'popular' it sorts by activity
sorting by replies sorts by how many replies there are
new by new
old by thread age




search bar on home page to search thread titles in all public(non private) forums

locked forums that are locked by password 
nsf boards cant be found by using search unless specifically asked by a button or something


make an account to keep track of forums you are subsribed to and get a 'hot catagory' from all the forums you are subsribed too 

homepage lists admin created forums and most popular user forums
users can create their own forum and edit it's css
each forum has tags so people can search for forums that fit their needs
forums can be locked with a password or private(no one without a direct link can enter, so it cant be found on search)
forum admins can choose to be completely anon, ids for ips and shit, or have registerable ids or a combination of the 3
registerable ids will expire if not logged in for 6 months
have users favourite forums in the top header so they can switch easily 


create an account to manage and create boards
change settings like header and subbed forums in profile and on a board clicking the top right
let forum admins make money buy selling stars that goes next to people's names
let them sponor their forum and put it in the sponor box
will fit as many subscriptions on the top header as possible before running out of room
everything needs to work without js
